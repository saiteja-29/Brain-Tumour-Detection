# Brain-Tumour-Detection
Building a detection model using a convolutional neural network in Tensorflow & Keras.
Used a brain MRI images data founded on Kaggle. You can find it here.
https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection.
#About the data:
The dataset contains 2 folders: yes and no which contains 253 Brain MRI Images. The folder yes contains 155 Brain MRI Images that are tumorous and the folder no contains 98 Brain MRI Images that are non-tumorous.

#Requirments:
python
pip install tensorflow scikit-learn opencv-python imutils matplotlib
